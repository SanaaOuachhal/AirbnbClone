    "notes": "I love taking care of my guests, and I really enjoy the feedback I receive from them. I constantly try to better accommodate the needs of my guests and work towards giving them the best possible experience while staying here. Here are a few examples of things I have improved as a direct result of feedback from my guests:  - Bought a Bose sound dock (loudspeaker) for the kitchen. - Installed an air purifier in the guest room to enhance air quality (especially suitable for people with pollen/dust allergy). - Got a new coat hanger/drying rack. - Got a full body mirror in the guest room. - Bought extra sets of towels so you can go to the beach or one of the many bathhouses or pool clubs.",
    "transit": "Arriving from Tegel Airport: Take bus TXL to Alexanderplatz and then change to U5 direction H\u00f6now and get off at Frankfurter Tor.  Arriving from Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport: Take train S9 to Frankfurter Allee and then change to U5 direction Alexanderplatz and get off at Frankfurter Tor.  Arriving by car: Parking spaces can be found on the street outside, but most of them are rather expensive. I recommend driving to Ostbahnhof and use the long-term parking there. From there you can take bus 240 or N40 to Simon Dach Stra\u00dfe.",
