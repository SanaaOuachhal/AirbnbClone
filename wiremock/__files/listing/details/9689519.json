    "neighborhood_overview": "The house is only 200m from S\u00fcdstern and K\u00f6rtestra\u00dfe in one of the most beautiful, and surprisingly quiet streets in bustling, hip Kreuzberg. This studio is a great for those who wish to live green, as you can find natural products nearby. Every Saturday there is a nice little farmer's market where you can eat or pick up fresh food and products, and there is also an organic grocery 1 block away. The very popular Bergmannstra\u00dfe also starts here, filled with quaint shops. There are also several very good options for breakfast nearby. The Fontanepromenade itself, Landwehrkanal, Hasenheide and the popular Tempelhof Park are all within a few minutes. All these, incidentally, are also wonderful for running paths. If you'd like, we will be happy to give you some tips.",

    "house_rules": "The studio is in a building with families with children. Therefore, please no parties or loud music. A good night's sleep is important for those who live here. Please treat the apartment with care, let me know if something is broken or needs to be replaced and, upon your departure, leave things as you found them. Smoking is not permitted in both the home and for the entrance and front of the house. If you lose the key, I regret that we will have to charge the full deposit ( EUR 100) , as the key is very expensive and special, and opens both the front door and apartment door. And of course no illegal streaming of TV , movies, music etc ...",
