    "neighborhood_overview": "The apartment is located in the trendy, vibrant district of Prenzlauer Berg, bordering on artistic, cosmopolitan Mitte. The Oderberger Strasse is a very lively yet very relaxed street that offers the distinctively bohemian vibe Prenzlauer Berg has been made famous for. Artsy caf\u00e9s, quaint boutiques and laid back restaurants make it a favourite destination of locals and visitors alike.  Neighbourhood highlights include the Kastanienallee with its dozens of bars, restaurants and coffee shops -among which the renowned Prater, Berlin\u2019s oldest beer garden- and the Mauerpark with its very popular Sunday flea market. The entertainment complex of the Kulturbrauerei is just around the corner, as well as the Kollwitzplatz with its fine wining and dining (and, of course, shopping). The not-to-be-missed Berlin Wall Memorial is in the vicinity of the apartments whereas Berlin landmarks such as the TV Tower or the Museum Island are a leisurely stroll.  This is an ideal base for exploring Berlin: rig",
